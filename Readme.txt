Politifact Text Classification

PolitiFact is a fact-checking website that rates the accuracy of claims by elected officials and others who speak up in American politics.
My aim is to build a Machine learning model that can detect if a quote said by a politician is True or False. In doing so, this model can be used to fact check quotes told by politicians in real time.
